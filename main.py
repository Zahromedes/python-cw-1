# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
Length = 10
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 5 
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
Area = Length + width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"The result is : {Area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"If the length of a rectangle is {Length}, and the width is {width}, then the area is: {Area}")
